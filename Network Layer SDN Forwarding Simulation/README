#this project is a simulation for a network routing packets to different routers based on port forwarding and destination IP addresses
#the "network.py" works as a server that takes packets in from an outside network and then routes those networks in a LAN to 4 different routers
#the routers are all object of the 'router' class and hold all the rules that help direct traffic around this simulated network
#the packets are their own object class called 'packet'.
#the packets and the routers rules and specificaitons for each router (their ip address, label, and what routers they connect to), are located in 'packets.csv', 'rules.csv', and 'routers.csv'


To run, you need to start two command promts/powershell windows/terminals. first start the network.py by typing in 'python network.py'. 
The network.py acts as a server and takes packets in from 'server.py', which acts as the client. Network.py will run forever.
Network.py will read in rules.csv and routers.csv, these hold the specifications for each router and the rules it has to follow in our mock network.
Uses port 5005 and sockets to communicate
Once network.py is running, go to your other terminal and run 'simulation.py' by typing in 'python simulation.py'

As long as the required CSV files are in the directory with simulation.py, network.py, and packets.py. simulation.py will read from 'packets.csv',
then use that informaiton to create our packet with specific input and send them to 'network.py', which will then route the packets around in our mock LAN
